# Weather Pop
A personalized Weather web application to display the current weather in the given United States City and State. It also gives forecast for the week, along with the ability to change the units of measurement, and from English to Spanish. 

Through the creation of this project, I had to learn what an API was and how it could be used to find the weather information for a given location. 

After this project, I hope to have a better understanding on how Javascript works with HTML, and how APIs are used in many other kinds of projects.
